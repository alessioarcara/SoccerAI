## Problem

::: columns

::: column
- **Context**: 
  - Over recent years, sports data analysis has gone from basic post game stats to using detailed time and space information to shape tactics, evaluate players and guide decisions during matches.

  ::: notes 
  - Teams can now see exactly where players move and interact throughout a match, helping them spot key opportunities and adjust tactics on the fly.

- **Our Task: Shot Prediction** 
  - **Objective**: Identify soccer actions that are likely to lead to a shot (versus non-shot actions) and quantify each player’s contribution to those actions.

  - **Input**: A combination of team-level positional data and individual player statistics.

- **Solution**:
  - Develop a Graph Neural Network that, as an oracle, ingests the current game state (capturing evolving spatio-temporal patterns) and outputs the probability of a shot. 
  - On top of that we want to understand the network’s probability outputs to uncover the patterns and features that drive its predictions.
