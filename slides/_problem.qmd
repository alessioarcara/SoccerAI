- **Context** ⚽
  - Over recent years, sports data analysis has gone from basic post game stats to using detailed time and space information to shape tactics, evaluate players and guide decisions during matches.

- **Our Task: Shot Prediction** 
  - **Objective**: Identify soccer actions that are likely to lead to a shot (versus non-shot actions) and quantify each player’s contribution to those actions.
  - **Input**: Team-level positional data and individual player statistics.

::: notes
- Teams can now see exactly where players move and interact throughout a match, helping them spot key opportunities and adjust tactics on the fly.

- **Solution**: 
  - Develop a **Graph Neural Network** that, as an oracle, ingests the current game state (capturing evolving spatio-temporal patterns) and outputs the probability of a **shot**. 
  - On top of that we want to understand the network’s probability outputs to uncover the patterns and features that drive its predictions.
