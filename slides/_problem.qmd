- **Shot Prediction**: Identify actions likely to end in a shot versus non-shot actions, using team positional and individual player statistics.  
- **Goal**: Develop a Graph Neural Network that, as a black-box oracle, ingests the current game state (capturing evolving spatio-temporal patterns) and outputs the probability of a shot.
- **Class Imbalance**: Shots are relatively rare compared to other events, making training difficult.
