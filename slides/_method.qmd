- **Workflow: From Frames to Chains** 
    - **First attempt**: We treated each frame as an independent sample and trained the network on these single frames, as they constituted a very large pool of training examples.
    - **Problem**: After several unsuccessful experiments, we realised that ignoring temporal dynamics severely limited the model’s performance on this task.
    - **Solution**: We encoded football actions as sequences of graphs of arbitrary length during which one team maintains possession of the ball.
    - **Augmentation**: We achieved a **4× increase** in the dataset by mirroring each sequence across the pitch, giving us a much larger pool of training examples. 

- **Temporal approach (Many-to-Many)** 
    - **Input**: A sequence of graphs $\mathbf{G_1, G_2, \dots, G_T}$, one for each timestep $\mathbf{t} \in \{1, \dots, T\}$.
    - **Architecture**: 
        - A **backbone** to extract **spatial informations** from the input graph 
        - A **neck** to **readout** and for **temporal processing** 
        - An **head** (MLP with dropout) for **prediction**
    - **Output**: For every timestep $\mathbf{t}$, a probability $\mathbf{{p}_t}$ that the current possession state will result in a shot.
