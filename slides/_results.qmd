##  Results

- **Evaluation criterion** → We judged each sequence as correctly or incorrectly labeled based only on the prediction for the final frame.
- **Neck** → a common finding is that **T-GCN** gives the most solid results as a neck; with this established, we then turned our attention to analyzing the backbones.
