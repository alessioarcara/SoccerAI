- **Why graphs?**
    - Graphs effectively represent spatial interactions between players, capturing and modelling the complexity of soccer. 
        - **Node features** embed informations about each player.  
        - **Edge connections** define how relationships between players are represented and influence message flow in the network. 
    
    - We model the problem as a **complete weighted bipartite graph** where each player is connected to every opponent. 
    - Inspired by Google DeepMind [TacticAI](https://rdcu.be/eult8) and [Goka et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4506)


- **Why bipartite connection?** 

    - This type of connection can reflect both direct **proximity** to opponents and the local defensive/offensive support structure.

    - When extended to a two-hop view, this construction captures:
        - **1-hop edges** → how many **opposing** players are nearby.
        - **2-hop edges** → how many of a player's own **teammates** are near those opponents.

- **Why weight the edges?**
    - Nearby interactions matter most, so we apply an **exponential decay** to pairwise **distances**, down weighting distant players and highlighting close ones.
    - Thus, edge weights are computed as $w_{ij} = e^{-d_{ij}}$, where $d_{ij} = \lVert {p}_i - {p}_j\rVert_2$ and ${p}_i, {p}_j$ denote the 2D field coordinates of players $i$ and $j$.
