### Data Sources & Statistics

- **Dataset**: [FIFA World Cup 2022 (PFF.com)](https://www.blog.fc.pff.com/blog/pff-fc-release-2022-world-cup-data)  
  - 64 matches total:
    - 48 group-stage → training set 
    - 16 knockout → validation set 
  - **Tracking Data**: camera-based, frame-by-frame positions (30 fps)  
  - **Event Data**: manually labeled actions (passes, shots, etc.)  
  - **Additional Player Statistics**: player profiles and performance scraped from **TransferMarkt** & **FBRef**


- **Focus: Event Data**
  - We start from the official **event logs** and enrich each event with the **60 preceding tracking frames**, allowing us to compute every player’s instantaneous speed and direction.
  - In total we analyse **19,048 tracking frames**, organised into chains that capture individual football actions.

- **Chain Statistics**:
  - 3 716 total chains
    - 2 546 Negative chains  
    - 1 170 Positive chains

### Feature Engineering & Normalization

- **Spatial features**
  - **x, y** → player position scaled by pitch dimensions ([0,1])
  - **vx,vy** → velocity components
  - **sinθ, cosθ** → player’s direction ([-1,1])
  - **ball_dist** → distance between player and ball ([0,$\sqrt{2}$])
  - **ball_direction_sim** → cosine similarity between player and ball direction ([-1,1])
  - **dz** → distance between player and ball’s z-axis coordinate ([0,1])

- **Categorical (one-hot)**: 
  - **is_ball_carrier** → the player has possession of the ball
  - **is_possession_team** → the player’s team has the ball
  - **player_Role** → player’s tactical role


- **Global features**: 
  - **possesionEventType**: type of possession action (one-hot)
  - **frameTime**: timestamp of the current frame (z-score)
  - **duration**: length of the possession event in seconds (z-score)

- **Player Stats**
  - **Player Metadata** → height, weight, market value (z-score)
  - **Player Shooting stats** → goals, shots, etc. (z-score)
