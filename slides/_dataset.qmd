  - 64 matches total:
    - 48 group-stage → training set 
    - 16 knockout → validation set 
  - **Tracking Data**: camera-based, frame-by-frame positions (30 fps)  
  - **Event Data**: manually labeled actions (passes, shots, etc.)  

- **Our Focus: Event Data**
  - Event data with 60-frame tracking data to compute player velocity and direction.
  - Total of 19 048 frames, each belonging to a chain that represents a football action.

- **Chain Statistics**:
  - 3 716 total chains  
    - 2 546 Negative chains  
    - 1 170 Positive chains 


- **Additional Player Statistics**:

### Feature Engineering & Normalization

- **Spatial features**
  - **x, y** → player position scaled by pitch dimensions ([0,1])
  - **vx,vy** → velocity components
  - **sinθ, cosθ** → player’s direction ([-1,1])
  - **ball_dist** → distance between player and ball ([0,$\sqrt{2}$])
  - **ball_direction_sim** → cosine similarity between player and ball direction ([-1,1])
  - **dz** → distance between player and ball’s z-axis coordinate ([0,1])

- **Categorical (one-hot encoded)**: 
  - **is_ball_carrier** → the player has possession of the ball
  - **is_possession_team** → the player’s team has the ball
  - **player_Role** → player’s tactical role


- **Global features**: 
  - **possesionEventType**: type of possession action (one-hot)
  - **frameTime**: timestamp of the current frame (z-score)
  - **duration**: length of the possession event in seconds (z-score)

- **Player Stats**
  - **Player Metadata** → height, weight, market value (z-score)
  - **Player Shooting stats** → goals, shots, etc. (z-score)
